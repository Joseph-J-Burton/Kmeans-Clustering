# Kmeans-Clustering

## K-Means Clustering Project
Project is from the Udemy course: 2022 Python for Machine Learning & Data Science Masterclass (by Pierian Data).  

## Purpose of Project
This is a unsupervised learning project that uses all the skills learned up to this point in the course.
The project analyzes a CIA world facts data set. The data set contains country names and facts like population size, land size,and gross national product. The project walks through exploring the data, then cleaning, and organizing the data. 
The data is then used to generate an interactive map to look at quantity of mobile phones per country.  
The goal of the project is to explore the data, explore the use of clustering, and gain an understanding of what the clusters mean.  

## Program version
- Python version 3.9.12  
- Jupyter Notebook version 6.4.8  
- Visual Studio version 1.73.1   
- Plotly 5.11.0  
- Tenacity 8.1.0 

## Skills
Read in data using pandas.  
Explore data set using pandas.  
Create visuals using Seaborn and matplotlib.
Clean the data and prepare for clustering.  
Visualize hierarchal clustering through seborn cluster map.  
Scale data through scikit-learn's standard scaler.  
Categorical substitution through panda's dummy variables function.  
Build a KMeans cluster model.  
Evaluate the ideal number of clusters through the use of an elbow plot.  
Assemble an interactive world map using Plotly.  


## Improvements
I need to go through the project and try adjusting other parameters to see if I can improve the efficiency of the model.
It may be good to reduce the lines by removing some redundancy of coding, e.g. looking at the data set after doing some filtering of the data frame.   
The code has some errors when using Plotly in Visual Studio, that need to be resolved. Works great in Jupyter Notebook.  

## Comments
I chose to include this exercise in my portfolio because it demonstrates the skills to organize data and use of the machine learning KMeans clustering method.
I found the course to be very valuable in learning the techniques through hands-on exercises!
